### DTR ###

## Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Molly & Suzie

## Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

### *** Molly ***
* Solid understanding of Git workflow (Re-DTR: Continue to work on solidifying muscle memory for branching workflow)
* Externalize thinking process
* Communicate and teach concepts that your confident in

### *** Suzie ***
* Concise and clear understanding
* Planning and pseudocoding project
* Learn the technical coding knowledge to pull my weight
* Be more confident with what I already know!

### *** Team ***
* Balancing our thinking processes (Re-DTR: Going well with thinking through methods independently to prep for discussion/coding)
* Goal: Reach Iteration 4, Expectation: Complete Clean Code for Iteration 3
* Goal (Re-DTR): Refactor our conditional methods and clean up all code through Iteration 3.
* Goal (Re-DTR): If we get to Iteration 4, feel like we have a really solid foundation to work from.

## Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

### *** Molly ***
* Structured and identifying areas of growth
* Code Strength: background in logic and linguistics - logical workflow and structure

#### Collaboration Styles:
* Open to new perspectives and test different ways
* Experimenting
* Work in longer chunks of time instead of shorter sessions

### *** Suzie ***
* Organizing workflow
* Secretarial pieces - keeping track of deadlines, creating flexible structures

#### Collaboration Styles:
* Like clear expectations
* Open to try new things
* Work long with short breaks sprinkled throughout

### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

* Preplanning
* Direct Communication Styles

### Re-DTR:
* Going well overall. POM timers are working and communication about being flexible on break times has been productive.
* Learning a lot about logic and working through those flows together has resulted in a lot of good progress.

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

### *** Molly ***
* 4:00 PM MST - 8:00 PM MST
* Weekend - flexible afternoons
* Slack - Ping when needed
* Living room - Partner might be moving around

### *** Suzie ***
* 7:00 AM MST - 8:00 PM MST
* Weekend - flexible
* Slack - Ping when needed
* Living room - Roommates might be moving around
* No coding Wednesday from 4pm-5pm

### *** Team ***
* 4:30 PM MST - 8:00 PM MST
* Saturday/Sunday after 4pm MST is blocked off
* Work Saturday so we can have some space for personal work on Sunday as needed.
* Plan to work from 11:30pm - 3:30pm MST on Saturday, Sunday we'll plan later.
* Plan on working 1pm - 4pm MST and then 4:30pm-8pm MST on Monday.
* We should have a functional/finished product by Tuesday evening. Light polishing/refactoring can be done on Wednesday, but we shouldn't be scrambling to finish critical pieces.

## Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

### *** Team ***

* Pair Programming - 4:30 PM - MST
  * Stand up - 5 min (What do we need to work on today? What needs to get done? Do we have any blockers? What's our emotional/mental status?)
  * Re-DTR: This hasn't been formal, but we have been having conversations around these things informally at the beginning of sessions.
* Slack
* Driver is the designated decision maker
  * Re-DTR: Haven't been doing this formally, really, but we haven't felt a real need for it. We've both been willing to try different things and have been able to align on an acceptable decision.
* Problem Solving:
  * Name the Problem
  * Research and Test
  * Ask in codehelp
  * Ask instructors
  * Ask mentors
* Re-DTR: Problem-solving was effective when planning questions for our Check-In with Mike.

## Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

## *** Molly ***

* Decision making about structuring big picture of application  
* Intentional project visioning and structure planning
* "Hey, Molly. Wait." - signal that we need to get on the same page

## *** Suzie ***

* Understanding Method and Class Scope and Interactions  
* "Hey, Suzie. Wait." - signal me when I'm rambling

## Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

### *** TBD at the RE-DTR ***

* This project requires pairing across all features, so we've been following the workflow we had discussed at the beginning.

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

* Driver creates new branch, push commit, creates all code on the branch and creates pull request (merge request)
* Navigator reviews pull request - look through for conflict merges
* Navigator becomes the Driver and creates new branch

*** TBD at RE-DTR ***

Pomodoro Break Schedule: 25 - 5

* This has been working well so far.
* We have been discussing when a break was badly timed, but making sure we still take breaks.

## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

### *** Molly ***
* Direct
* Sooner, rather than later

### *** Suzie ***
* Direct
* Sooner, rather than later

## Additional Remote Considerations:

### *** Molly ***
* Pretty solid remote setup
* Backup laptop
* Power Outage - use phone  

### *** Suzie ***
* Pretty solid remote setup
* Backup laptop
* Power Outage - use phone

## Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
